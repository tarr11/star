#Star.json#

My personal json based file format for storing bookmarks.

Why?

I prefer to have my primary source of data be in files and folders.  I just like that better.  

* I can edit them in my favorite text editors (vim, sublime text, visual studio)
* I can publish and unpublish at my whim to websites, dropbox, github, or anywhere else that supports files
* I am not constrained to a relational db schema.
